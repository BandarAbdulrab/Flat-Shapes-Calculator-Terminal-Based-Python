# Flat Shapes Calculator (Terminal-based, Python)

Terminal-based Python program designed to calculate the area and perimeter of various flat shapes. The program supports calculations for squares, circles, rectangles, triangles, parallelograms, trapezoids, rhombuses, pentagons, octagons, and hexagons. It is a handy tool for students, educators, and anyone needing quick geometric calculations.

## Features
- **Square**: Calculate area and perimeter.
- **Circle**: Calculate area and circumference.
- **Rectangle**: Calculate area and perimeter.
- **Triangle**: Calculate area and perimeter (supports equilateral and non-equilateral triangles).
- **Parallelogram**: Calculate area and perimeter.
- **Trapezoid**: Calculate area and perimeter.
- **Rhombus**: Calculate area and perimeter.
- **Pentagon**: Calculate area and perimeter.
- **Octagon**: Calculate area and perimeter.
- **Hexagon**: Calculate area and perimeter.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository or download the Python file
2. Run the program using Python 3
3. Select a flat shape by entering the corresponding number (1-10)
4. Enter the required dimensions for the selected shape:
- Square: Enter the side value
- Circle: Enter the radius value
- Rectangle: Enter length and width
- Triangle: Enter base and height, and additional side values if not equilateral
- Parallelogram: Enter base and height
- Trapezoid: Enter height, two bases, and two sides
- Rhombus: Enter two diagonals and a side
- Pentagon, Octagon, Hexagon: Enter the side value
5. The program will display the area and perimeter of the selected shape
