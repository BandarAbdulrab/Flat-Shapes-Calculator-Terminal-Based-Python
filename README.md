# Flat Shapes Calculator (Terminal-based, Python)

Terminal-based Python program designed to calculate the area and perimeter of various flat shapes. The program supports calculations for squares, circles, rectangles, triangles, parallelograms, trapezoids, rhombuses, pentagons, octagons, and hexagons. It is a handy tool for students, educators, and anyone needing quick geometric calculations.

## Features
- **Square**: Calculate area and perimeter.
- **Circle**: Calculate area and circumference.
- **Rectangle**: Calculate area and perimeter.
- **Triangle**: Calculate area and perimeter (supports equilateral and non-equilateral triangles).
- **Parallelogram**: Calculate area and perimeter.
- **Trapezoid**: Calculate area and perimeter.
- **Rhombus**: Calculate area and perimeter.
- **Pentagon**: Calculate area and perimeter.
- **Octagon**: Calculate area and perimeter.
- **Hexagon**: Calculate area and perimeter.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository or download the Python file
2. Run the program using Python 3
3. Use the menu to perform operations:
- Option 1: View all tasks with their details and status
- Option 2: Add a new task with description, times, deadline, priority, category, and status
- Option 3: Edit an existing task by entering its number and updating fields
- Option 4: Delete a task by entering its number
- Option 5: Exit the program
4. Tasks are automatically saved to two files:
- Tasks File(Code Formated).txt: Stores tasks in a code-friendly format
- Tasks File(Readable Formated).txt: Stores tasks in a human-readable format
