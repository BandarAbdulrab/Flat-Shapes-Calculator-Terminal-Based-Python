# Flat Shapes Calculator (Terminal-based, Python)

Terminal-based Python program designed to calculate the area and perimeter of various flat shapes. The program supports calculations for squares, circles, rectangles, triangles, parallelograms, trapezoids, rhombuses, pentagons, octagons, and hexagons. It is a handy tool for students, educators, and anyone needing quick geometric calculations.

## Features
- **Square**: Calculate area and perimeter.
- **Circle**: Calculate area and circumference.
- **Rectangle**: Calculate area and perimeter.
- **Triangle**: Calculate area and perimeter (supports equilateral and non-equilateral triangles).
- **Parallelogram**: Calculate area and perimeter.
- **Trapezoid**: Calculate area and perimeter.
- **Rhombus**: Calculate area and perimeter.
- **Pentagon**: Calculate area and perimeter.
- **Octagon**: Calculate area and perimeter.
- **Hexagon**: Calculate area and perimeter.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository or download the Python file
2. Run the program using Python 3
3. Select an operation by entering the corresponding number (1-10)
4. Enter the required numbers based on the selected operation:
